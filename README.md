Go Ban game in python 
The project is organized as follows:
Game Logic (go.py): This component encapsulates the core game logic, including stone placement, group management, and game rules.

Graphical User Interface (main.py): This module handles the user interface, drawing the game board, stones, and player interactions.
The collaboration of these components creates a holistic Go game experience, allowing players to focus on strategic gameplay and enjoy the artistry of the game.
